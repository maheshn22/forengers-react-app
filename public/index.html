      content="Forengers emerged out of a simple idea to plant one sapling per week. With this philosophy, we hosted an event on social media to invite anyone who was interested and saw a good turnout. And it has grown ever since, now we host cleanliness drives along with plantation campaigns. Each sapling we plant is tagged, covered with a shed of bamboo and cloth, watered 4 times a week and tracked for growth. We ensure that every sapling survives the next monsoon season so that it can survive the later stages on its own. Moreover, the garbage we collect is disposed to composting facilities or recycling centers based on the nature of waste ensuring minimum impact.
      We want to shift the focus of masses from mere concern to action. A lot is being shared by people in classrooms, social media platforms, etc but we aim to provide our community a platform where they can actually make an impact."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
